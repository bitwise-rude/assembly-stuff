# ABSTRACT
This repo contains some of the fun stuff that assembly has to offer. I basically use this repo to learn assembly and build some tools for fun.

## Assembler?
I have used `FASM` here, which is known for its minimal executable output, i really like it. It just does what you want no more no less, compared to others. I don't hate others but I love nasm more and I just know like the 1% of it and still its cool. I would love it to give it more time and make more things with it.

## Some Nice things.
1. The coolest thing has to be `neocat.asm`. This is my attempt in making the `cat` command found in most linux distros. Works the same way but is only `4.5KB` in size compared to the original `cat` which is more than a 100 KB. 
2. `linking_with_libc` explores how one can link assembly written in `FASM` to an external library (shared in this case)
